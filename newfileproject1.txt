What it does...
It runs any executable (with complete command line) available in the system from current working dir (command must be in Path or in job's workspace directory or subdirectory).
Automatic conversion of file separator is done according to the executing operating system.
Variable style is converted according to the executing operating system. E.g. $JOBPARAM1 is converted to %JOBPARAM1% in the command if the executing operating system is Windows.
Constraints:

the current working directory of the command execution is always the job's workspace root.
./ must not be included in command line (use the configuration switch provided to specify that command is in current working dir or subdir).
